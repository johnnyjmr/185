You may work in teams of 2 or 3 people. Each person needs to submit his/her own copy of the
solutions. At the top of your work include a header that lists all persons on the team.
1.
    a. List the six falsy values that exist in JavaScript.
        0,-0,empty String, undefined,null,false
    b. Which of those values are considered equal using the == operator?
                        0   NaN  empty String    undefined   null    false
        0               T   T       F               T          T       T
        NaN                 F       F               F          F       F
        empty String        F       T
        undefined           F                       T
        null                F                                  T
        false           T   F                                         T

        0== " "==FALSE
        NULL==Undefined
        NaN
    c. Which of those values are considered equal using the === operator?
        they will only convert if they are exacly the same type and value
2.
    a. List four ways to convert a string to a number in JavaScript.
        parseInt(num); // default way
        parseInt(num, 10); // parseInt with radix (decimal)
        parseFloat(num) // floating point
        Number(num); // Number constructor

    b. For each of the four ways, what is the result of calling it with the string “5”?
        5 converted to number with parseInt(num); is 5
        5 converted to number with parseInt(num, 10); is 5
        5 converted to number with parseFloat(num); is 5
        5 converted to number with Number(num); is 5
    c. For each of the four ways, what is the result of calling it with the string “3.14159”?
        3.14159 converted to number with parseInt(num); is 3
        3.14159 converted to number with parseInt(num, 10); is 3
        3.14159 converted to number with parseFloat(num); is 3.14159
        3.14159 converted to number with Number(num); is 3.14159
    d. For each of the four ways, what is the result of calling it with the string “oops”?
        oops converted to number with parseInt(num); is NaN
        oops converted to number with parseInt(num, 10); is NaN
        oops converted to number with parseFloat(num); is NaN
        oops converted to number with Number(num); is NaN
    e. For each of the four ways, what is the result of calling it with the string “123Hello”?
        123Hello converted to number with parseInt(num); is 123
        123Hello converted to number with parseInt(num, 10); is 123
        123Hello converted to number with parseFloat(num); is 123
        123Hello converted to number with Number(num); is NaN
    f. For each of the four ways, what is the result of calling it with null?
        null converted to number with parseInt(num); is NaN
        null converted to number with parseInt(num, 10); is NaN
        null converted to number with parseFloat(num); is NaN
        null converted to number with Number(num); is 0
    g. For each of the four ways, what is the result of calling it with undefined?
        undefined converted to number with parseInt(num); is NaN
        undefined converted to number with parseInt(num, 10); is NaN
        undefined converted to number with parseFloat(num); is NaN
        undefined converted to number with Number(num); is NaN
3. Write a program that writes “Hello World” to the JavaScript console.
You should turn in a single file that has a .js extension.
    console.log("Hello World");
4. Write a program that prompts the user to guess a number between 1 and 100.
    If the guess is greater than 42, alert the user with the message “Too high”.
    If the guess is lower than 42, alert the user with the message “Too low”.
    If the guess is 42, then alert the user with the message “The Answer to the Ultimate
    Question of Life, the Universe and Everything”.
You should turn in a single file that has a .js extension.
