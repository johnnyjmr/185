Web Client Development Assignment 2

You may work in teams of up to three people. Each person needs to submit their own copy of the solutions. At
the top of your work include a header that lists all persons on the team.

1. Write a game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive). It then prompts
the user to guess the number according to the following rules:
• If the user guesses too low, it prompts the user to guess higher.
• If the user guesses too high, it prompts the user to guess lower.
• If the user guesses correctly, it prints “You win, the number is x” (where x is the random number chosen
by the computer).
• If the user enters something that is not an integer or is not in the range of [1-100], it prints “x is not a valid
guess” (where x is whatever the user entered).
The game does not end until the user guesses the correct number.
You should turn in a single js file for this problem.

2. Write a function named “countCharacters” that accepts a string of text as it’s first parameter. It counts how
many times each character within that string is used. It should have an optional second parameter that
determines whether it is case-insensitive (e.g. does ‘a’ === ‘A’?).
It should return an array of arrays where each inner array has two elements: [0] = the character and [1] =
the count. The outer array should be sorted based on the count of each inner array. Higher counts should
come before lower counts. The function signature should look like the following (TypeScript is used for
illustration):
/**
 * Counts the number of occurrences of each character in the specified text.
 *
 * @param {string} text The string of text whose characters will be counted.
 * @param {boolean} caseInsensitive (optional) Whether uppercase and lowercase letters will be
 * treated as equal.
 * @returns {[string, number][]} An array of arrays. The first element of each inner array is
 * the character and the second element is the count. The outer
 * array is sorted such that those characters with the highest
 * count come first.
 */
function countCharacters(text: string, caseInsensitive?: boolean): [string, number][] {
 // TODO: your code here
}
