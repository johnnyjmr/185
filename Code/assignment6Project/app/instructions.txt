Assignment 6 Instructions
*You may work in teams of up to 3 people. Each person needs to submit his own copy of the
solutions. At the top of your work include a header that lists all persons on the team.
Before starting this assignment, you need to download and unzip the assignment6Project.zip
folder from Brightspace. The project folder contains an html file, a stylesheet, images, and a
JavaScript file. You will write your code in the JavaScript file.
For this assignment, you are going to implement the feature that was demonstrated in the video
where you can hover over an image to view a larger copy of that image.
Here are the rules:
• When the mouse is over an image, then a larger version of that image should be shown.
• The larger image must be contained in a div that has a CSS class of image-display.
• The image display must be created just as the mouse moves over the smaller image.
• The image display must be 15px to the right of the mouse and 15px down below the mouse.
• The image display must follow the mouse as long as it’s still over the smaller image.
• When the mouse is moved so that it is no longer over the smaller image, then the image
display must be deleted.
